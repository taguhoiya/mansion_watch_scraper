To use **Scrapy Shell** you need to have Scrapy installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install scrapy
```

Once you have Scrapy installed, you can use the following command to open the Scrapy Shell:

```bash
scrapy shell <target_url> --nolog
```
